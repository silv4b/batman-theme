# How to install

[Back](README.md)  

## In the market

Just follow this [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=silv4b.batman-theme) .

## With terminal

Just run this line in your vs code integrated terminal:  

`code --install-extension silv4b.batman-theme`.

## With the *.vsix file  

I personally use the [Install vsix](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-install-vsix) extension to install vsix files, visit the store or install with this command:  

`code --install-extension fabiospampinato.vscode-install-vsix`  .
