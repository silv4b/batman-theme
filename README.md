# Batman Theme �🦇

[Install it ✨](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=silv4b.batman-theme)

## About

Here is another VS Code theme, builded by myself. I like dark themes so it's full dark (again!).

A dark Barman theme. I took inspiration from the [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) and the [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) themes AND Batman of course.

## To install

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
